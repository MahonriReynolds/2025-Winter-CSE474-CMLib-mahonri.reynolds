## 1. Purpose and scope

This document outlines the Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP) for the development and deployment of the Kitchen Compass project. The SQAP defines processes and practices to ensure the delivery of a high-quality app for grocery and meal planning. This plan aims to integrate seamlessly into existing meal planning workflows, optimizing user experience through streamlined recipe suggestions and automated grocery lists. Additionally, the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) document provides a high-level overview of how the Kitchen Compass app will function from a user perspective, and is referenced as a guiding document for system operations.

In accordance with contract [KLD-2786-BJHVG](#3-reference-documents), the Kitchen Compass app is a mobile solution designed to streamline meal planning. Key features include:
- Recipe suggestions based on dietary preferences and inventory.
- Grocery list creation and price comparisons.
- Shopping trip schedule and list recommendations.


The SQAP applies to all phases of software development, from design to deployment and maintenance.
