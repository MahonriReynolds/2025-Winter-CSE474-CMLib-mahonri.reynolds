## Final Question Responses

* I may have missed it, but I didn't see a role for a generic QA manager. I found quality as a project requirement but not an actual role assigned like the other requirements had. But a project needs someone who directs only the quality assurance efforts. I think this is an important role to include because someone needs to be directly responsible for the quality of the product. It's too important to be an implied responsibility of the collective team.

* This role would take the place of the general Quality role in the chart. The current Quality block should really be a team led by the QA manager.

* The more specific QA manager role would formulate a guide for checking the quality of the product. This would include the count of defects, the milestones being met, the general quality of the project components, and many more. Their responsibility would be to report on the state of the project as far as quality goes and present directives to keep the project on track.
